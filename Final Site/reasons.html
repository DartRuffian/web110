                <h2>Reasons to Misinform</h2>
                <p>There can be many reasons why a person or group of people would want to create a source of misinformation. There are also several different types of misinformation, which you can read about in the <a href="misinformation_types.html">Types of Misinformation</a> section.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>"The Ends Justify the Means"</dt>
                    <dd>A group may feel so strongly towards a political party, ideology, or some other force, that they believe that "the ends justify the means". Meaning that anything is okay if it gives them a better chance to "win", whatever that may mean in that context. In poltics specifically, people are much easier to be swayed by emotion than by reason, and a convincing story may just sway more people to vote for that party.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>"I'm Better than Them"</dt>
                    <dd>Another reason that misinformation can form is from people who get joy from making others look foolish. It may come from a need to feel smarter than others, or to make money from the attention, or possibly some other reason. Whatever the reason is, they spread misinformation to make themsevles feel above others.</dd>

                    <dt>Money</dt>
                    <dd>Websites on the internet commonly make money through advertisements, and the best way to do that is to have as many viewers on your website as possible. Compelling stories that seem believable can attract the large groups of readers that make huge profits. If the author already knows their target audience, they can cater specifically to that group and keep feeding content that gets new viewers, and therefore more money.</dd>

                    <dt>Mental Illness or Other Pathologies</dt>
                    <dd>Some creators of fake news may fully believe the content they are writing. Another possibility is that the author is a pathological liar, and has a compulsion to create false stories and share them.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Politics</dt>
                    <dd>The reasoning to using misinformation in politics should be apparent already, one example being distracting people and make other issues seem less important than they are.</dd>

                    <dt>Confusion and Losing Faith</dt>
                    <dd>For more specific examples of why a group may use information, we'll look at groups trying to destroy Democracies. If parties completely demonize those who do not agree with them, or have no idea which sources to trust, then the Democracy that they operate in can no longer function properly.</dd>
